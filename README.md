# Flooring
```
Hi,
(I found you in "Everybody's Business etc.")
  Rain water came into the house and under several feet of laminate flooring.
The gutters over some french doors on pool-side of our house overflowed.

I pulled up several planks to get a shop-vac and now de-humidifier on it, but
there are damaged planks.  

I have *some* material left-over from the original install.

I would like to have an estimate on pulling up a 100 sq.feet or so, checking for
rot and damage, and then installing from the left-over material.

Is this something you'd be interested in sizing for me?

Thank you!

Hi,
You were original installers for my flooring 10+ years ago!
Well, rain water came into the house and under several feet of the laminate flooring.   The gutters over our french doors on the pool-side of the house overflowed.

I pulled up several planks to get a shop-vac and now de-humidifier on it, but
there are damaged planks.  I have *some* material left-over from the original install, but I think the planks are no longer in production.

I would like to have an estimate on pulling up a 100 sq.feet or so, checking for
rot and damage, and then installing from the left-over material.  We may have to do something *else* if there is too much damage, so would like advise as well. 

Is this something you'd be interested in sizing for me?
Thank you!

Hi,
(I found you in "Everybody's Business etc.")
  Rain water came into the house this week after overflowing the gutters over some french doors on the pool-side of our house.
We need an evaluation of what kind of re-work is needed to prevent this in the future.

Is this something you'd be willing to look into?
I could send pictures if that would help.

THANK YOU!!
